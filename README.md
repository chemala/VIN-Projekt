# Robot Arm Color Sorting
My project's goal is to utilize a servo-driven robot arm to sort objects into separate areas by their color.
I will accomplish this by using an Ultrasonic sensor to detect a placed object, read its color with a Color Sensor and then move it to a place corresponding to its color using the robot arm.

## Components

* Arduino UNO 
* Arduino Nano 
* TCS230 Color Sensor 
* HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 
* 5V 15A Power Supply 
* 5-Axis 6 Servo Robot Arm

>> The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It is used for prototyping and simple electronics projects. It has 14 digital I/O pins of which 6 are also PWM outputs, which the servo motors use as a signal input for moving to a distinct position (degree).
