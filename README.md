# VIN-Project Robot Arm Color Sorting
My project's goal is to utilize a servo-driven robot arm to sort objects into separate areas by their color.
I will accomplish this by using an Ultrasonic sensor to detect a placed object, read its color with a Color Sensor and then move it to a place corresponding to its color using the robot arm.
